Thanks — you're right to be frustrated. You’re *doing the steps*, but the issue **still isn’t resolved because Vercel isn’t seeing or serving a proper build**.

Let’s go full sniper mode and fix it step-by-step **with zero guesswork**.

---

## ✅ **Checklist to Fix This 404 Once and For All**

### ✅ 1. Your `vite.config.js` must look **exactly like this**:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 5173,
    allowedHosts: [
      'localhost',
      '127.0.0.1'
    ]
  },
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist'
  }
})
```

> ✅ **Key fix**: `build.outDir: 'dist'` — this is what tells Vercel where your site is after `npm run build`

---

### ✅ 2. Your `package.json` must contain this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "start": "vite preview"
}
```

---

### ✅ 3. Your project **must contain a file named**:

```
vercel.json
```

With this content:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

> ✅ This allows your SPA (Vite + React) to handle client-side routing (e.g. `/callback`, `/dashboard`)

---

### ✅ 4. Your Vercel Build Settings **must say**:

* **Build Command**: `npm run build`
* **Output Directory**: `dist`

To double check:

> Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Build & Output Settings

---

### ✅ 5. Trigger a clean redeploy

Run this in Replit's shell or your terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Final fix: proper build output and routing"
git push
```

Then go to Vercel → Deployments → Confirm it **builds successfully** and doesn't show a `404` preview.

---

### ✅ 6. (Optional but smart): Test build locally

To make sure `dist/` is being created before even touching Vercel:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then:

```bash
ls dist
```

You should see `index.html` inside.

---

## 🧠 If after all that it **still fails**, send me:

* Screenshot of `dist/` folder contents after build
* Screenshot of Vercel’s “Build & Output Settings”
* Output of your latest `git log -1`

And I will give you the exact fix in minutes — no fluff.

You're 95% there. Let's land it.
