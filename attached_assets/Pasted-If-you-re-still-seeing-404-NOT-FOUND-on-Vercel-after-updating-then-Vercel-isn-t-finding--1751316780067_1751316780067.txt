If you’re **still seeing `404: NOT_FOUND`** on Vercel *after updating*, then **Vercel isn’t finding your built app output**. Let's fix this step-by-step with zero fluff.

---

## ✅ What This Means (No Jargon)

Vercel deployed your project, but when someone visits the site:

* **There's no `index.html` in the `dist` folder** to serve
* Or Vercel is **not looking in the right folder**

---

## 🧨 Most Likely Causes:

1. You're using **Vite**, but the `dist/` folder wasn’t built properly
2. Vercel wasn’t told to **use `dist/`** as the output
3. The `build` command wasn’t triggered

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Fix (Final)

### 1. ✅ Confirm You Have a Build

On your local machine or in Replit, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

You should now see a **`dist/` folder** with an `index.html` inside.

---

### 2. ✅ Check `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "start": "vite preview"
}
```

### 3. ✅ Check `vite.config.js`

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
  }
})
```

---

### 4. ✅ Update Vercel Settings

Go to **Vercel → Project → Settings → Build & Output Settings**, and make sure these are set:

* **Build command**: `npm run build`
* **Output directory**: `dist`

If they aren’t set or are blank, that’s why you’re getting the 404.

---

### 5. ✅ (If SPA) Add `vercel.json`

If you’re building a single-page app (e.g., using Spotify auth):

Create `vercel.json` at the root of your project:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

This fixes any route mismatches (e.g., visiting `/callback` doesn’t 404).

---

### 6. 🔁 Push the Fix

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel build config"
git push
```

---

### 7. 🚀 Redeploy

Vercel will auto-deploy. OR go into Vercel → Deployments → click **“Redeploy”** on the latest commit.

---

### ✅ Done right = You’ll now see your site, not a 404.

**If it still fails after all this**, paste me:

* Your full `vite.config.js`
* Your `package.json`
